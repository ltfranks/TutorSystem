# TutorSystem

This project was developed as part of the Software Engineering series of classes at Cal Poly SLO by a team of five. It utilizes MVC architecture and Object-Oriented Programming principles to create an intelligent tutoring system.

## Overview

The tutor is designed to assist students by providing automated tutoring for programming problems. The system leverages the OpenAI API to interpret and respond to user queries, offering explanations and guidance on various programming topics.

## Features

- **Agile Development Process**: Led bi-weekly sprints and stand-ups within a 4-person team, adhering to Agile SDLC practices.
- **Intelligent Tutoring**: Developed a tutor assistant that processes user help requests for given programming problems using the OpenAI API.
- **MVC Architecture**: Implemented the Model-View-Controller design pattern to ensure a clear separation of concerns and enhance maintainability.
- **Database Integration**: Utilized SQL for storing, retrieving, and analyzing user interactions to improve the tutoring experience over time.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for application development.
- **SQL**: Database management for storing user interactions and data.
- **OpenAI API**: Integrated to provide intelligent responses to user queries.
